        <p>Every row in the picks section represents a game. To select your picks, click on the space with the name of the
            team that you think is going to win. If you
            think the game will end in a draw, then select the space with the text "DRAW".</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once you are ready to submit your picks, simply click on the button that says "Submit Picks". If everything
            goes well, a message will
            pop up letting you know that your picks were successfully submitted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can always go back and change your picks as long as you do it before the day the gameweek starts. The
            section includes a timer that will let you know how many hours you have before you are no longer able submit
            your
        picks for that gameweek.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By default, all picks are set to "DRAW". This means that if you forget to make your picks before the
            deadline, you will automatically pick "DRAW" for every game.</p>
